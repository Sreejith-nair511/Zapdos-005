# Power Outage Response Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of specific AI responses for power outage reports in the Digital Sarpanch voice console system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Specific Responses for Power Outage
Three detailed responses have been created specifically for power outage reports:

1. **Response 1**: "Power outage reported in your area. Technician has been dispatched and will arrive within 24 hours. For immediate assistance, please contact the emergency helpline at 1912."

2. **Response 2**: "We've registered your power outage report. Our team is aware of the issue in your area. Estimated restoration time is 6-8 hours. You'll receive an SMS update when the technician is on the way."

3. **Response 3**: "Thank you for reporting the power outage. We've logged your complaint and assigned it priority status. A technician will contact you within 2 hours. In the meantime, please stay safe."

### 2. Logic Implementation
The system now includes special handling for the exact phrase "Power outage in our area." When this phrase is detected:
- The system cycles through the three specific responses in order
- Each subsequent request shows the next response in the sequence
- After the third response, it loops back to the first

### 3. Technical Changes
- Added `powerOutageResponses` array with the three specific responses
- Modified `handleStop` function to detect power outage transcripts
- Implemented cycling logic to rotate through the three responses
- Created demo page to showcase the functionality

### 4. Files Modified
1. `components/voice-console.tsx` - Core logic implementation
2. `app/power-outage-demo/page.tsx` - Demonstration page

## User Experience
- Citizens receive specific, helpful information for power outage reports
- Responses include estimated timeframes and emergency contact information
- System provides rotating responses to avoid repetition
- Clear visual indication of which response is currently active in the demo

## Testing
The functionality can be tested through the demo page at `/power-outage-demo` where users can:
1. Use the voice console to simulate saying "Power outage in our area"
2. See the three responses cycle through
3. Understand how the system works

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with actual power department APIs for real-time updates
2. Location-based response customization
3. SMS notification system integration
4. Multi-language support for responses
