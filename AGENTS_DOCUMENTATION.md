# AI Agents Documentation

## Overview

Digital Sarpanch implements a multi-agent AI system to handle various aspects of rural governance. Each agent is specialized for a specific domain and works collaboratively to provide comprehensive solutions.

## Agent Architecture

The system consists of 7 specialized agents that work together:

1. **Farm Agent** - Agriculture and crop management
2. **Water Agent** - Water resource management
3. **Power Agent** - Electricity and power distribution
4. **Welfare Agent** - Social welfare schemes
5. **Market Agent** - Market prices and trade
6. **Education Agent** - Educational services
7. **Coordinator Agent** - Multi-agent coordination

## Agent Communication
