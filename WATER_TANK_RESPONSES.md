# Water Tank Response Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of specific AI responses for water tank level reports in the Digital Sarpanch voice console system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Specific Responses for Water Tank Issues
Three detailed responses have been created specifically for water tank reports:

1. **Response 1**: "Water tank level critical. Refill scheduled for tomorrow morning between 6-8 AM. You'll receive an SMS confirmation shortly."

2. **Response 2**: "We've registered your water tank issue. Emergency water supply truck dispatched. Estimated arrival time: 2 hours. Please conserve water until then."

3. **Response 3**: "Thank you for reporting the low water level. Our team has scheduled a refill for today. You should have water by evening. For immediate needs, contact the helpline at 1912."

### 2. Logic Implementation
The system now includes special handling for the exact phrase "Water tank is almost empty." When this phrase is detected:
- The system cycles through the three specific responses in order
- Each subsequent request shows the next response in the sequence
- After the third response, it loops back to the first

### 3. Technical Changes
- Added `waterTankResponses` array with the three specific responses
- Modified `handleStop` function to detect water tank transcripts
- Implemented cycling logic to rotate through the three responses
- Created demo page to showcase the functionality

### 4. Files Modified
1. `components/voice-console.tsx` - Core logic implementation
2. `app/water-tank-demo/page.tsx` - Demonstration page

## User Experience
- Citizens receive specific, helpful information for water tank reports
- Responses include estimated timeframes and emergency contact information
- System provides rotating responses to avoid repetition
- Clear visual indication of which response is currently active in the demo

## Testing
The functionality can be tested through the demo page at `/water-tank-demo` where users can:
1. Use the voice console to simulate saying "Water tank is almost empty"
2. See the three responses cycle through
3. Understand how the system works

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with actual water department APIs for real-time updates
2. Location-based response customization
3. SMS notification system integration
4. Multi-language support for responses
5. Predictive analytics for water demand forecasting
